    <!-- Firstly I'd like to reference the video on a similiar project by James Q Quick 
        whose JS code was the basis for the functions in Pokedex.js along with the animation
        effects implemented in Pokedex.CSS below is the link to the video I used to learn
        what was needed for this project
        
        https://youtu.be/T-VQUKeSU1w Build a Pokedex with Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

        Secondly I'd like to reference Pokeapi.co which is where all the data on the individual
        Pokemon comes from. Without their extensive database from which to draw on for information
        this project probably would've taken far longer. 

        https://pokeapi.co/ Their website

    <!-- Functionality: This web application is meant to simulate the pokedex of the generation
    5 Unova Dex from Pokemon Black and Pokemon White. Each Pokemon has its own entry in the dex
    which contain a sprite of the pokemon, The pokemon's National dex id number, the Pokemon's
    name and the Pokemon's abilities. Clicking on the Pokemon's image will open the bulbapedia
    page of that Pokemon in a new tab.
